# billionaires-analysis
The number of billionaires in a country says a lot about the business environment, start-up success rate, and many other economic features of a country. The dataset that I used to analyse the data about billionaires around the world was curated by robes and is downloaded from Kaggle. The data set contains information about global billionaires in 2021, including their: names, net worth, country, source, rank, age, industry. After importing necessary libraries, I remove the missing values from the data.  Next, in the net worth column ‘$’ sign and ‘B’ at the end  were removed and convert Net Worth column to float. Summary – this is how I can find patterns among billionaires around the world to analyse the business environment of countries. The success of a business or start-up depends a lot on the business environment of a country. At the end of the analysis of global billionaires, I found that China and United States are the countries with the most billionaires which include that the business environment and the success rate of start-up is much better in the US and China than in the rest of the world.
